# Unet_segmentation_nuclei
Conducted U-Net segmentation to perform semantic segmentation on a given dataset of nuclei across varied conditions. This semnatic segmentation for nuclei detection can speed up research for many diseases such as lung cancer, heart diseases etc. Research in this field can speed up the process of fighting with these diseases because the identifictaion is the starting point for the analysis of the cells whose detection can help us in finding the affected tissues and cells and thus help us in knowing the root cause and location which in turn results in speeding up of the procedure of finding cure. Identifying the nuclei helps in identifying the cell and this results in scientist observing and identifying the reactioon to those particular cells to different medications/treatments. I did this project by following the video series :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azM57JuQpQI. Through this project,video lectures and articles on medium i was able to create a U net segmentation model to perform semantic segmentation of the given nuclei. Through this project i gained knowledge about semantic and instance segmentation and how to successfully implement it.
